Copy pyopengl and setuptools eggs from the Python site-packages to the distribution directory.
Modify the names in w32setup.py and main.py if versions differ


Notes from first beta:
============================================================
py2exe worked after disabling bundling on w32setup.py.
I later removed *.pyd and then re-added _ctypes.pyd.

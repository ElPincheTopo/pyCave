pyCave is a clone of the game SFCave for the palm pilot.

To run, you will need to meet the following dependencies:

Python >=2.5
PyGame >=1.8

Run the script to build the C extension

    $>./make_cext

It is not necessary, but startup time is criminal without it.

Then you can run the game.

$>./pycave



About:
I tried to keep it close to the original. The shadows are
a completely unnecessary addition, but they look cool. They
are also a good example of PyOpenGL doing something non-trivial.
If you stay alive long enough, you will enter hardcore mode;
Then you probably won't survive to see the end of the tunnel.
You might tell that the art leaves a lot to be desired. If you
are willing to make a better model of the ship,
(and get it working with my rudimentary .obj and/or .tga loaders), I will
replace my model. Otherwise, I will eventually make a better model with
decent textures.

The game has been tested on:

Ubuntu 8.10 x64 with Nvidia 8 series
Windows Vista x64 with Nvidia 8 series
MacOs 10.5 laptop with integrated Intel GMA x3100 (Only works on Python 2.6 atm...)
Windows XP laptop with integrated Intel (model?)

I hope you enjoy the game! 

============================================================
Building a fresh checkout
============================================================

If you checked out a fresh version from SVN, you need SWIG to
create the extension.
Go to src/ and do:

   $> swig -python cext.i

Uncompress PyOpenGL.tar.gz into src/ so
that pyCave has a local, tested, version of the OpenGL module.

If you're having graphics problems after that, then it's a bug ;)

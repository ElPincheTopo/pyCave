pyCave is a clone of the game SFCave for the palm pilot.

To run, you will need to meet the following dependencies:

2.5<=Python<3.0
PyOpengl
pyGame (Only the mixer module is necessary)


About:

I tried to keep it close to the original. The shadows are
a completely unnecessary addition, but they look cool. They
are also a good example of PyOpenGL doing something non-trivial.
There is a daredevil bonus if you pass close enough to a
bar and at an angle of more than 45 degrees.
If you stay alive long enough, you will enter hardcore mode;
Then you probably won't survive to see the end of the tunnel.
You might tell that the art leaves a lot to be desired. If you
are willing to make a better model of the ship,
(and get it working with my rudimentary .obj and/or .tga loaders), I will
replace my model. Otherwise, I will eventually make a better model with
decent textures.

This is the first Beta version. It's feature-complete but it hasn't been
tested on more than 3 machines (on linux and windows). If you have
any problem you should give me the details so that I can fix the program.

I hope you enjoy the game!

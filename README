pyCave is a clone of the game SFCave for the palm pilot.

To run, you will need to meet the following dependencies:

Python (tested on 2.5,2.6. Not for Python 3)
All other dependencies are included.

About:
I tried to keep it close to the original. The shadows are
a completely unnecessary addition, but they look cool. They
are also a good example of PyOpenGL doing something non-tri vial.
If you stay alive long enough, you will enter hardcore mode;
Then you probably won't survive to see the end of the tunnel.
You might tell that the art leaves a lot to be desired. If you
are willing to make a better model of the ship,
(and get it working with my rudimentary .obj and/or .tga loaders), I will
replace my model. Otherwise, I will eventually make a better model with
decent textures.

The game has been tested on:

Ubuntu 8.10 x64 with Nvidia 8 series
Windows Vista x64 with Nvidia 8 series
MacOs 10.5 laptop with integrated Intel GMA x3100
Windows XP laptop with integrated Intel (model?)

I hope you enjoy the game!
